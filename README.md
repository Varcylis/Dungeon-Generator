# Dungeon-Generator

A rough upload of my project's current state.
There are 2 proper maze algorithms recreated, stack_maze and recurse_maze, simple_recurse_maze being a variant of the latter.
The third algorithm, spore_dungeon, is a creative test for a simple dungeon generator.
Main starts in Dungeon_generator, also included in this file is a class for the renderer.
